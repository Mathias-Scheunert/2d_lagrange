# Install

- clone the repository: `git clone git@git.tu-freiberg.de:ng/2d-lagrange.git`
- get the Gmsh executable binary from [(Gmsh)](http://gmsh.info/#Download) and copy the file somewhere to your repo, e.g. `<repo_path>/+Mesh/`

Note that the code was developed at MATLAB 2017b on an Ubuntu 16.04.1 using Gmsh 3.0.6.
<br/>
Hence, there might be some issues w.r.t. to missing MATLAB builtin functions at older version or conflicts with new Gmsh versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Update: MATLAB 2015 and 2016 supported

# Misc

The motivation for this repo was to get familar with the (implementation of the) FE method.
<br/>
Hence, it provides only the basic functionality which can be extended ad libitum.
<br/>
I used the codestyle, introduced at [(codestyle)](https://git.tu-freiberg.de/ng/toolbox/blob/master/template/codeStyleTemplate.m).

Feel free to use this repo for:
- teaching
- developing (geo)physical applications
- just playing around ... 

# Features

Mesh:
- arbitrary bounded domains (exctracted areas at interior allowed)
- initial mesh variants: uniform splitted rectangle
- uniform mesh refinement
- Gmsh: 
	- routine to create default Gmsh .geo input file (rectangular domain including topography, TX/RX positions) originally written for 2.5D DC problem
	- routine to load arbitrary mesh from Gmsh .msh output files (2D and 3D supported)
	- using Gmsh physical tags to identify parameter domains (surfaces) and boundary parts (lines) from .msh

DC application:
- assembling of DC 2D and 2.5D system and solution
- creation of a wavenumber set for 2.5D problem
- import of DC measurement configuration from a BERT formatted file
- export of DC measurement configuration to a BERT formatted file
- creation of a DC measurement configuration for given electrode positions
    - currently supported: Wenner
- creation of a measurement operator for the transformation of modelled electrical potential to observed apparent resistivity

Lagrange elements:
- 2D first and second order

Raviart-Thomas elements:
- 2D zeroth order

Assembling of:
- Lagrange:
    - mass and stiffness matrix
    - tensor representation for derivative of these matrices w.r.t. the parameter
    - interpolation operator for observing solution at arbitrary points within the domain
- Raviart-Thomas:
    - mass and divergence matrix
    - regularization matrix representing smoothness conatraints for unstructured grids
- rhs vector for point source(es)
- rhs vector for given reference function

Boundary conditions:
- homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet
- homogeneous and inhomogeneous Neumann

Visualization:
- mesh with parameter, edge orientations and normals
- Lagrange FE solution within domain/mesh
- Lagrange FE solution gradient within domain/mesh
- Raviart-Thomas elements/basis functions (on local, reference simplex and in global mesh)
